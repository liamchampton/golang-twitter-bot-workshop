# Lab 0 - Install the Prerequisites

### IBM Cloud command line interface

(If you already have these setup and installed, go straight to [Lab 1](https://github.com/liamchampton/golang-twitter-bot-workshop/tree/efa5cd3e0eb58088d221e17d65c2860f1cf99420/Lab1/README.md)\) // FIX THIS LINK

1. Install the [IBM Cloud command-line interface from this link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

   Once installed, you can access IBM Cloud from your command-line with the prefix `ibmcloud`.

2. Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI: `ibmcloud login`.
3. Enter your IBM Cloud credentials when prompted.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login --sso` to log in to the IBM Cloud CLI. Enter your user name, and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
{% endhint %}

Once you are all set up you can move straight on to [Lab 1](https://github.com/liamchampton/golang-twitter-bot-workshop/tree/efa5cd3e0eb58088d221e17d65c2860f1cf99420/Lab1/README.md) // TODO: FIX THIS LINK
