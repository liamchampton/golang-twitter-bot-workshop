# Lab 1 - Creating a basic Golang Application :books:

In this very first Lab you will clone the repository of the project to make the setup slightly easier and ensure you can run a simple "Hello world" program.

### Step 1

// TODO: FIX THIS LINK

Clone [this](./) repository into `$HOME/<user>/go/github.com` and then open the project directory into your preferred editor. (I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the recommended [Go extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) installed from the marketplace)

### Step 2

Lets start by making a simple `Hello-World` program.

Open the `main.go` file and add the code below:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello Fellow Gopher")
}
```

Save the file and then run it. To do this, navigate to the directory in a new terminal window and use the command `go run cmd/main.go`. This will compile the code and run the program without building a binary (more on this later). The output in the terminal should be `Hello Fellow Gopher!`.

In the next lab we will turn this up a notch and turn your simple `hello world` program into a web server.
