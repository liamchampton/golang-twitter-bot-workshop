# Lab 1 - Creating a basic Golang Application :books:

In this very first Lab you will clone the repository of the project to make the setup slightly easier and ensure you can run a simple "Hello world" program.

### Step 1

// TODO: FIX THIS LINK

Clone [this](./) repository into `$HOME/<user>/go/github.com` and then open the `<PROJECT NAME HERE>` directory into your preferred editor. \(I use Visual Studio Code with the recommended [Go extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) installed from the marketplace\)

### Step 2

First you need to make sure you can run the `main.go` file \(located in `<PROJECTNAME>/cmd`\). To do this, navigate to the directory in a new terminal window and use the command `go run cmd/main.go`. This will compile the code and run the program without building a binary \(more on this later\). The output should be `Hello Fellow Gopher!`.

Now the code is running successfully, you can see everything has been set up correctly and you are able to run Go code on your machine.

In the next lab we will turn this up a notch and turn our simple `hello world` program into a web server.
